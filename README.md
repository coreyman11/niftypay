# Nifty Pay

Nifty Pay allows NFT creators to configure their NFT collections and enable their holders to unlock IRL experiences with their NFTs.

Thinking out loud, the verify_nft will be the main function we can call from the front end, which will be where the NFT account owner info will be put into the program via solana pay. Esectially the person will snan the QR code that the Merchant has posted, and confirms transaction. And the transaction they're approving it our program going and checking if they do actaully ownthe NFT and that its the correct NFT.
